* Added multilingual Almond tasks [#10].

0.2.0a2
=======

* Misc bug fixes [#8, #9]

0.2.0a1
=======

New features:
* Add new tasks for Almond: almond_dialogue_nlu, almond_dialogue_nlg, almond_dialogue_policy
* Added a new encoder, "Coattention", which encodes the context and question separately, then
  coattends and applies a BiLSTM layer.
* For Coattention and Identity encoder, it is now possible to specify the context and question
  embeddings separately.
* Embeddings in context, question and answer can now be untied, by suffixing the name with '@'
  followed by an unique identifier (e.g. bert-base-uncased@0 and bert-base-uncased@1).
* Added an option to pretrain the context encoder, using MLM objective.
* Added beam search.
* New embedding option: XLM-R (XLM trained with Roberta).
* New task: paraphrasing with GPT2. This is not fully integrated with the other tasks yet,
  but it will in the future.
* New command "genienlp export" can be used to save a trained model for inference.

Incompatible changes:
* The --save flag is now required when calling train
